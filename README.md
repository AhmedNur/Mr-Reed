# Mr-Reed
A Chrome extension that allows you to quickly look up terms in Weblio's English - Japanese dictionary.

## Installation
Mr-Reed has not yet been added to the Chrome web store. Installation requires you to follow the instructions provided [here.](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked)

## CORS Proxy

Mr-Reed currently uses [corsproxy.io](https://corsproxy.io/) to help retrieve definitions from Weblio. Should Mr-Reed become a publicly available extension, this service will be replaced by either creating a private CORS proxy service or by finding / creating an open source dictionary file to replace Weblio.
